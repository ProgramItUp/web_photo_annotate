# Coordinate Calculation Fix Summary

## Problem
The application had a bug where mouse cursor coordinates weren't properly transformed when the image was zoomed. This caused:
- Incorrect coordinates displayed in the UI
- Annotations placed at wrong positions
- Recording and replay of annotations to be misaligned

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a comprehensive fix by:

### 1. Creating Centralized Coordinate Conversion Utilities

Added two key functions to `js/utils.js`:

```javascript
function canvasToImageCoordinates(canvasX, canvasY) {
    const zoom = window.zoomLevel || 1;
    return {
        x: Math.round(canvasX / zoom),
        y: Math.round(canvasY / zoom)
    };
}

function imageToCanvasCoordinates(imageX, imageY) {
    const zoom = window.zoomLevel || 1;
    return {
        x: imageX * zoom,
        y: imageY * zoom
    };
}
```

### 2. Updated Mouse Event Handling in Canvas.js

- Modified `checkAndLogMouseMovement()` to convert canvas coordinates to image coordinates for display
- Updated `updateCursorTrail()` to use canvas coordinates for display but image coordinates for recording
- Fixed mouse event handlers to properly convert coordinates during recording

### 3. Fixed Bounding Box Tool Functionality

In `js/drawing-tools.js` we:
- Updated `handleBoundingBoxMouseDown()` to use proper coordinate conversion
- Fixed `handleBoundingBoxMouseMove()` for tracking in both canvas and image coordinate spaces
- Modified `handleBoundingBoxMouseUp()` to ensure consistent image coordinates for saved annotations

## Key Principles

1. **Display vs. Recording Separation**:
   - Canvas coordinates used for display elements (maintains visual alignment)
   - Image coordinates used for recording (ensures accuracy regardless of zoom)

2. **Consistent Conversion**:
   - All conversions use the same utility functions
   - All coordinate transforms consider zoom level

3. **Improved Logging**:
   - Log messages now show image coordinates to match what's recorded

## Testing Strategy

To verify the fix:
1. Test at various zoom levels (0.5x, 1x, 2x)
2. Verify cursor position matches image pixels
3. Confirm annotations appear at exactly the clicked positions
4. Test replay functionality to ensure annotations appear at original locations

## Next Steps

Future improvements could include:
1. Adding a visual calibration grid for easier verification
2. Unit tests for coordinate conversion functions
3. Visual debugging mode to show both coordinate systems simultaneously
